# Zero-Acknowledgement

[See Confirmed Zero Acknowledgement List](https://github.com/DeffoN0tSt3/Zero-Acknowledgement/blob/main/confirmed/Zero-Acknowledgement-Confirmed.md)

The  Zero-Acknowledgment Repository serves as a platform to bring attention to companies, organizations, and government entities that neglect to publicly recognize the valuable contributions made by security researchers who submit valid reports. 

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to shed light on instances where entities fail to provide proper acknowledgment to security researchers. It aims to raise awareness and encourage accountability by showcasing cases where these entities do not appropriately acknowledge the efforts and expertise of researchers who contribute to their security practices.

### But why?

Acknowledging the efforts and expertise of security researchers is crucial for maintaining a healthy and collaborative relationship between researchers and entities. When security vulnerabilities are responsibly disclosed, it benefits both the reporting researcher and the entity by allowing vulnerabilities to be addressed before they can be exploited maliciously. Publicly acknowledging these contributions not only gives credit where it is due but also demonstrates a commitment to security and fosters trust within the broader community.

The Zero-Acknowledgment Repository seeks to address situations where entities neglect to provide proper acknowledgment to security researchers. By publicly identifying these cases, the repository aims to:

1. **Raise Awareness**: Many entities may not be aware of the importance of acknowledging security researchers publicly. The repository serves as a platform to educate entities about the significance of recognition and the positive impact it can have on their security practices.

2. **Encourage Accountability**: By showcasing instances of inadequate acknowledgment, the repository holds entities accountable for their actions or lack thereof. It brings attention to the discrepancy between the effort put in by security researchers and the recognition they receive, pushing entities to improve their practices.

3. **Drive Positive Change**: The repository aims to promote positive change within the security research community. By highlighting entities that overlook proper acknowledgment, it sends a clear message that a more inclusive and appreciative environment is necessary. This, in turn, encourages entities to establish acknowledgment mechanisms and appreciate the contributions of security researchers.

4. **Facilitate Transparency**: The repository fosters transparency by providing a centralized resource that researchers, security enthusiasts, and the wider community can use to identify entities that may not appropriately credit and appreciate security researchers. It enables individuals to make informed decisions about their engagement with these entities and promotes transparency within the industry.

The purpose of the Zero-Acknowledgment Repository aligns with the broader goal of enhancing security practices, fostering collaboration, and building stronger relationships between security researchers and the entities they assist. By addressing the lack of acknowledgment, the repository aims to create a more inclusive and appreciative environment that benefits the entire security research community.

## How it Works
This repository will aim to provide a comprehensive list of companies, organizations, and government bodies that lack a publicly accessible acknowledgment page or a similar platform to credit and appreciate security researchers. It serves as a centralized resource for researchers, security enthusiasts, and the wider community to identify entities that may overlook proper recognition and appreciation.

## Contribution Guidelines
To contribute to this repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Ensure that the entity you are adding does not have a public acknowledgment page or equivalent platform.
2. Include relevant details such as the entity name, its industry, and any supporting evidence or references.
3. Submit your contribution by creating a new issue or pull request, providing clear and concise information.

Please note that all contributions should be respectful and objective, focusing solely on the lack of acknowledgment. This repository aims to promote positive change and awareness rather than fostering negativity or hostility.
