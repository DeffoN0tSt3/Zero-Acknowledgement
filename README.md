# Zero-Acknowledgement

[See Confirmed Zero Acknowledgement List](https://github.com/DeffoN0tSt3/Zero-Acknowledgement/blob/main/confirmed/Zero-Acknowledgement-Confirmed.md)

The  Zero-Acknowledgment Repository serves as a platform to bring attention to companies, organizations, and government entities that neglect to publicly recognize the valuable contributions made by security researchers who submit valid reports. 

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to shed light on instances where entities fail to provide proper acknowledgment to security researchers. It aims to raise awareness and encourage accountability by showcasing cases where these entities do not appropriately acknowledge the efforts and expertise of researchers who contribute to their security practices.

## How it Works
This repository will aim to provide a comprehensive list of companies, organizations, and government bodies that lack a publicly accessible acknowledgment page or a similar platform to credit and appreciate security researchers. It serves as a centralized resource for researchers, security enthusiasts, and the wider community to identify entities that may overlook proper recognition and appreciation.

## Contribution Guidelines
To contribute to this repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Ensure that the entity you are adding does not have a public acknowledgment page or equivalent platform.
2. Include relevant details such as the entity name, its industry, and any supporting evidence or references.
3. Submit your contribution by creating a new issue or pull request, providing clear and concise information.

Please note that all contributions should be respectful and objective, focusing solely on the lack of acknowledgment. This repository aims to promote positive change and awareness rather than fostering negativity or hostility.

We appreciate your contributions in advancing the acknowledgment culture within the security research community. Together, let's foster a more inclusive and appreciative environment for all security researchers.

## Disclaimer
The Zero-Acknowledgement Repository is an open resource and does not intend to defame or harm any entity listed. The inclusion of an entity in this repository simply highlights the absence of public acknowledgment and serves as an opportunity for them to improve their security practices.
