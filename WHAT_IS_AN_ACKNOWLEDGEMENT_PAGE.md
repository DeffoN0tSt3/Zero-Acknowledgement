# What is an Acknowledgment Page?

An acknowledgment page, also known as a Hall of Fame, Security Researchers Page, or similar terms, is a dedicated section on a company's website, organization's platform, or government body's portal that publicly acknowledges and recognizes the contributions of security researchers who have submitted valid reports.

## Purpose of an Acknowledgment Page

The primary purpose of an acknowledgment page is to provide a platform for entities to publicly express gratitude and appreciation towards security researchers who help identify vulnerabilities, bugs, or other security issues within their systems. It serves as a means to recognize the expertise and efforts of these researchers and demonstrates the entity's commitment to fostering a collaborative and secure environment.

## Components of an Acknowledgment Page

An acknowledgment page typically includes the following components:

1. **List of Researchers**: It contains the names, aliases, or usernames of security researchers who have made significant contributions to the entity's security. This list may also include a brief description of their findings or achievements.

2. **Acknowledgment Statements**: The page may feature statements expressing appreciation, gratitude, and recognition towards the security researchers. These statements often emphasize the importance of their work in strengthening the entity's security posture.

3. **Links to Researcher Profiles**: Acknowledgment pages may provide hyperlinks to the online profiles or websites of the security researchers, allowing visitors to explore their backgrounds and accomplishments.

4. **Additional Information**: Some acknowledgment pages include additional information, such as the entity's responsible disclosure policy, guidelines for security researchers, or information on how to report vulnerabilities.

## Benefits of an Acknowledgment Page

An acknowledgment page offers several benefits to entities and security researchers, including:

- **Recognition**: Security researchers receive public recognition for their valuable contributions, which can enhance their professional reputation and credibility within the security community.

- **Collaboration and Trust**: Acknowledgment pages foster a sense of collaboration and trust between entities and security researchers, encouraging further engagement and cooperation in identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities.

- **Transparency and Accountability**: Publicly acknowledging security researchers demonstrates an entity's commitment to transparency and accountability in addressing security issues, which can help build trust among users and customers.

- **Community Building**: Acknowledgment pages contribute to the development of a strong and supportive security research community, promoting knowledge sharing, mentorship, and collaboration among researchers.
